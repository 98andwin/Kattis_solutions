If the digits are in ascending order, just swap the last two digits.

If the digits are in descending order, it's the largest number possible.

Otherwise find the rightmost pair where the left digit is smaller than the right digit.
That's your pivot, find the smallest digit larger than left digit in the pair above and on the right side of the pivot.

Switch and then sort the right side of the pivot.
