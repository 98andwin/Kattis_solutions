Sort the numbers from lowest to highest.

Check the quotient and update if lower was found.

If the quotient is larger than 1, it's impossible (since one balloon will explode).


Example:

4
3 2 2 1

Sorted becomes
1 2 2 3

Checking quotients
1/1 = 1
2/2 = 1
2/3 = 0.666666 (update)
3/4 = 0.75

Output: 0.666666
