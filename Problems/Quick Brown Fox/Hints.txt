Create an array of size 26 (amount of letters in the alphabet) and put a 1 in index of letters ascii representation.

Check upper and lowercase characters separately.

Once you've gone through all the characters, if all are 1s it's a pangram.
Else just output the character, tip is with "char letter = index + 97".
