Check every n-length word combination and keep track on how many you've seen.

For each n-length, you only calculate with the most frequent word you found.

You can use unordered map for storage of words you've seen.

Remember that you need to filter out words if you've just seen them.

For example EEEEEE and you are checking all 3-length words, there are 2 "EEE"s we can substitute but if you blindly use a for-loop it'll find 4 "EEE"s.
So have an array of words you have recently seen and only add if it's not in the array, and update accordingly.
