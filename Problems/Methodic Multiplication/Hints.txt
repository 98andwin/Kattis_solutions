You can check the amount of S's in each word, they multiply to the amount of S's in the result.

If you have a "Time Limit Exceeded", add all 'S('s first, second the 0, and then all the ')'s.
Cause if you add in the beginning of the string and not the end, the computer have to create a new string for each concatentation. This can add up very quickly.
