Save everything into a 2D array and check respective 5*3 rectangle.

There are multiple ways of checking which number it is. I checked the sum of every occupied index.


1 	2 	3
4 	5 	6
7 	8 	9
10 	11 	12
13 	14 	15

For example "1" would occupy indexes 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 which would give the sum 45.
