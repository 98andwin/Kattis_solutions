# Kattis_solutions

## Starting here

In this repo are my solutions of the open kattis problems for C++.

## Prelude
This was my way of learning C++ from scratch, doing all the easy problems on the site and working my way up. While it took some time I did learn a lot on the way, having the documentation up also helped me tremendously to understand this mess of a language. [Link to documentation](https://cplusplus.com/reference/) [Another link](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)

## Structure

### README.md
Well, you made it here. In this file there is info about this repo.
### folder
Every folder in this repo contains a .cpp file with my solution. Most folders also contain a compiled executable which you can use and verify if trying on your own.

Naming convension is the default name of the file for that certain problem. For example the problem **Bacon, Eggs and Spam** has the filename *baconeggsandspam*. (Prob will be changed in due time).

## Fair use
While this repo is intended to help people understand some of the problems and show my provess, this is my work that I've made myself. If you decide to use any of the files of the repo, you are allowed to do so as long as you reference it to this repo. (aka. don't be an ass and give credit where credit is due. I spent some time putting this thing up).
